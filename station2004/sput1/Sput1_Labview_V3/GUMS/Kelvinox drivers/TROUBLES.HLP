Trouble shooting tips:

1. GPIB seems very slow.
This can occur on Windows 95 with the 
NI488.2M drivers when the board is not
using IRQ. You may need to release an
IRQ for the card to use.

2. Instruments are not responding
Ensure that the ISOBUS address is set.

3. GPIB just will not work.
Power off all instruments and the 
computer. Ensure that the card is 
properly seated in the computer and 
that all cables are connected.
Run the diagnostic test for the card.
